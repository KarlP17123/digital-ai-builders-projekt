        <h2>Our Technical Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          To build these advanced AI solutions, we use a range of powerful
          coding languages and modern development methodologies:
        </p>
        <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
        <p>
          We use the most popular and powerful programming languages for AI
          development, including Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and R. Python is
          particularly important for most AI applications thanks to its
          extensive libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
        </p>
        <h3>AI Methods and Technologies</h3>
        <p>
          Our projects are based on the latest methods in machine learning (ML),
          deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and reinforcement
          learning. We also use technologies such as Generative Adversarial
          Networks (GANs) to create unique content and neural networks for
          advanced prediction and analysis.
        </p>
        <h3>Tools and Frameworks</h3>
        <p>
          We work with reputable AI frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras,
          PyTorch, OpenAI GPT, spaCy, and Scikit-learn, depending on the needs
          and requirements of the project. For web development and integration
          of AI into digital platforms, we also use popular tools such as React
          and Node.js.
